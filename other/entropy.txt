Entropy:

Is the randomness collected by an operating system or application for use in
cryptography or other uses that require random data. This randomness is often
collected from hardware sources (variance in fan noise or HDD), either
pre-existing ones such as mouse movements or specially provided raandomness
generators. A lack of entropy can have a negative impact on performance and
security

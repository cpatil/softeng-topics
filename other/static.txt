Static Variable: Is a variable that has been allocated "statically", meaning
that its lifetime is the entire run of the program. this is in contrast to
shorter-lived automatic variables, whose storage is stack allocated and
deallocated on the call stack; and in contrast to objects, whose storage is
dynamically allocated and deallocated in heap memory;

Container Builders - Turn source code into a container image Container Images -
Archive files containing a "runnable" application Containers - Run container
Images

Java EE: Contianer Builders == Gradle or Maven Container Images == .jar, .war,
or .ear Containers == JBoss, WebSphere, WebLogic

Docker/OCI: Container Builders == Dockerfile, Buildpacks, or Jib Container
Images == .tar files usually not dealt with directly but through a "contianer
registry" Containers == Docker, Kubernetes, Cloud Run

Container Image: A container is a way of executing processes with isolation
provided by 3 Linux technologies - chroot, namespaces, and cgroups

chroot changes the file system root (/) that a process can see. This allows a
process to use any directory as if it were a file system root instead of the
actual file system root

namespaces group resources together (like network and process IDs) so that only
processes within a namespace can see the resources of that namespace

cgroups set CPU and memory limits for processes

The combination of these allows processes to run in isolation from other
processes both on the file system level and on the resource utilization level.

A container image includes the application and any run-time dependencies and is
simply a directory of files along with metadata about how to run the container

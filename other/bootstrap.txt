Bootstraping (compilers) The technique for producing a self-compiling compiler -
that is, a compiler (or assembler) written in the source programming language
that it intends to compile.

An initial core version of the compiler (the bootstrap compiler) is generated in
a different language (which could be assembly language); successive expanded
versions of the compiler are developed using this minimal subset of the
language. 

The problem of compiling a self-compiling compiler has been called the
chicken-or-egg problem in compiler design, and bootstrapping is a solution to
this problem

Process:

Stage 0: preparing an environment for the bootstrap compiler to work with Stage
1: te bootstrap compiler is produced Stage 2: a full compiler is produced by the
bootstrap compiler Stage 3: a full compiler is produced by the stage 2 full
compiler

The full compiler is built twice in order to compare the outputs of the two
stages. If they are different, either the bootstrap or the full compiler
contains a bug

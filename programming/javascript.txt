JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to
the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time
compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing,
prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.

Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World
Wide Web. Over 97% of websites use it client-side for web page behavior, often
incorporating third-party libraries. Most web browsers have a dedicated
JavaScript engine to execute the code on the user's device.

As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and
imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs)
for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and
the Document Object Model (DOM).

The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as
networking, storage, or graphics facilities. In practice, the web browser or
other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.

JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but they are now
core components of other software systems, most notably servers and a variety of
applications.

Although there are similarities between JavaScript and Java, including language
name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two languages are distinct
and differ greatly in design. 

Most web browsers including the vast majority of Android and all iPad browsers
have a built-in JavaScript engine that executes the code on the user's device.
Examples of scripted behavior

    Loading new web page content without reloading the page, via Ajax or a
    WebSocket. For example, users of social media can send and receive messages
    without leaving the current page. 
	
	Web page animations, such as fading objects in and out, resizing, and moving
	them. 
	
	Playing browser games.
    
	Controlling the playback of streaming media. Generating pop-up ads.
    
	Validating input values of a web form before the data is sent to a web
	server. 
	
	Logging data about the user's behavior then sending it to a server. The
	website owner can use this data for analytics, ad tracking, and
	personalisation. 
	
	Redirecting a user to another page.

Libraries and frameworks

	Over 80% of websites use a third-party JavaScript library or web framework for
	their client-side scripting.

	jQuery is by far the most popular library, used by over 75% of websites.
	Facebook created the React library for its website and later released it as open
	source; other sites, including Twitter, now use it. Likewise, the Angular
	framework created by Google for its websites, including YouTube and Gmail, is
	now an open source project used by others.

	In contrast, the term "Vanilla JS" has been coined for websites not using any
	libraries or frameworks, instead relying entirely on standard JavaScript
	functionality.

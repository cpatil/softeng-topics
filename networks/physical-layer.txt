Physical Layer:
Defines the means of transmitting a stream of raw bits over a physical data link connecting network nodes
    - A node is either a redistribution point or a communication endpoint. A physical network node is an electronic device that is attached to a network, and is capable of creating, receiving, or transmitting information over a communication channel

The bitstream may be grouped into code words or symbols and converted to a physical signal that is transmitted over a transmission medium.
    - A bitstream/bytestream is a sequence of bits/bytes.

Provides an electrical, mechanical, and procedural interface to the transmission medium.

There are two main types of transmission media:
Guided media: waves are guided along a solid medium such as a transmission line (twisted pair, coaxial cable, optical fiber)

Unguided media: transmission and reception are achieved by means of an antenna (radio)

The shapes and properties of the electrical connectors, the frequencies to broadcast on, the line code to use and similar low-level parameters, are specified by the physical layer
    - A line code is a pattern of voltage, current, or photons used to represent digital data transmitted down a transmission line



There are at least three types of basic data-link configurations that can be conceived of and used:
    - Simplex communications, most commonly meaning all communications in one direction only
    - Half-duplex communications, meaning communications in both directions, but not both ways simultaneously
    - Duplex communications, communications in both directions simultaneously

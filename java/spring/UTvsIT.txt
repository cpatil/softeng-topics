Typically in an enterprise you would write two types of test cases. One Unit
Test cases where you will use Mockito to stub out object like repository objects
etc. The idea is the your functionality is testable even if a db is not
available. Another set is integration test cases. This will in fact connect to
all the resources etc in the backed to do an end-to-end testing. You can use
Maven's surefire plugin to run the test case during run time. A class with name
ending in "Test" is considered a Unit Test case and ending in "IT" is an
integration test case. Example ("SomeTest", SomeIT). To answer your question you
need both Mockito and H2 where H2 being the resource/backend of ur application

By definition, Design Patterns are reusable solutions to commonly occuring
problems(in the context of software design). Design patterns were started as
best practices that were applied again and again to similar problems encountered
in different contexts. They become popular after they were collected, in a
formalized form, in the Gang Of Four book in 1994. Originally published with c++
and smaltalk code samples, design patterns are very popular in Java and C# can
be applied in all object oriented languanges. In functional languages like
Scala, certain patterns are not necesary anymore.

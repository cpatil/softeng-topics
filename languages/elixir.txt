Elixir is a dynamic, functional language for building scalable and maintainable
applications. 

Elixir leverages the Erlang VM, known for running low-latency, distributed, and
fault-tolerant systems. Elixir is successfully used in web development, embedded
software, data ingestion, and multimedia processing, across a wide range of
industries. 

Functional programming (also called FP) is a way of thinking about software
construction by creating pure functions. It avoid concepts of shared state,
mutable data observed in Object Oriented Programming. 

Functional langauges empazies on expressions and declarations rather than
execution of statements. Therefore, unlike other procedures which depend on a
local or global state, value output in FP depends only on the arguments passed
to the function.

There are two different ways to scale: vertical scaling and horizontal scaling. Vertical scaling, also known as scaling up, is adding more power, or increasing the capacity of a single machine or server for better performance.

For example, you can scale up by adding resources, such as CPU, RAM, or disk capacity to add more processing power to your existing machine. In cloud terms, this translates into increasing the instance type for your application.  In the short term, vertical scaling creates a bigger, better machine for an application to run on. Additionally, vertical scaling is data consistent, as your data is stored on a single node / instance. One caveat to scaling up, however, is that it comes with limits to the amount of hardware that can be added to a single machine. Vertical scaling also introduces potential for hardware failures. Vertical scaling is easy in the sense that there is no need for as additions only are made to the machine, but is easier better? Not necessarily.

Horizontal scaling, or scaling out, is when you add more machines or servers to your existing pool of resources. In cloud terms, this is referred to as Auto Scaling where the cloud OS can adjust capacity to demand needs. Rather than adding to a single machine as in scaling up, scaling out is duplicating a current set up and breaking it into separate resources.

Instead of changing the capacity of your existing server you are decreasing the load of the server through additional, duplicate servers. More resources might come appear more complex for your business but scaling out pays off in the long run, especially for larger enterprises. Instead of worrying about upgrading hardware as with vertical scaling, horizontal scaling provides a more continuous and seamless upgrading process.

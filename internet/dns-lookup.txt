When you type www.google.com we actually call www.google.com. The . at the end represents the Root of the Internet’s namespace.

Browser checks its own cache and if not found it asks OS for IP.

OS then checks if the IP address is in memory (cache).

If the browser and the operating system(cache) both don’t know the IP address, then the operating system is configured to ask the Resolving Name Server (RNS) for IP addresses it doesn’t know.

RNS is the main workforce for the DNS lookup. It is configured both manually and automatically within your OS.

The OS then queries the RNS for the IP. RNS may or may not have the IP in cache.

The only thing that all the RNS must know is where to find the Root Name Servers, i.e., the . that appears after every url at the end.

The Root Name Servers will reply with where to find the com name servers.

The com name servers are the Top Level Domain (TLD) name servers.

RNS then caches the info that it com from Root Name Servers and goes to TLD servers.

The TLD name servers will reply by saying the location of google.com name servers. 

The next set of name servers are the Authoritative Name Servers (ANS).

RNS then caches the info that it com from TLD Name Servers and goes to ANS.

ANS will now reply by saying that it knows the IP address of the URL.

RNS will now save the IP address in its cache and then gives the reply to the OS.

The OS then hands over the IP address to the browser.

Then the browser makes a connection the IP address requesting a web page for the Url.

This entire cycle takes a fraction of a sec.

Browser -> OS -> DNS Lookup -> RNS -> Root Name Server -> TLD -> ANS -> RNS -> OS -> Browser

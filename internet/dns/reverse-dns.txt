What is reverse DNS?

	A reverse DNS lookup is a DNS query for the domain name associated with a
	given IP address. This accomplishes the opposite of the more commonly used
	forward DNS lookup, in which the DNS system is queried to return an IP
	address.

	Standards from the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) suggest that every
	domain should be capable of reverse DNS lookup, but as reverse lookups are
	not critical to the normal function of the Internet, they are not a hard
	requirement. As such, reverse DNS lookups are not universally adopted. How
	does reverse DNS work?

How does reverse DNS work?

	Reverse DNS lookups query DNS servers for a PTR (pointer) record; if the
	server does not have a PTR record, it cannot resolve a reverse lookup. PTR
	records store IP addresses with their segments reversed, and they append
	".in-addr.arpa" to that. For example if a domain has an IP address of
	192.0.2.1, the PTR record will store the domain's information under
	1.2.0.192.in-addr.arpa.

	In IPv6, the latest version of the Internet Protocol, PTR records are stored
	within the ".ip6.arpa" domain instead of ".in-addr.arpa."

What are reverse DNS lookups used for?

	Reverse lookups are commonly used by email servers. Email servers check and
	see if an email message came from a valid server before bringing it onto
	their network. Many email servers will reject messages from any server that
	does not support reverse lookups or from a server that is highly unlikely to
	be legitimate. Spammers often use IP addresses from hijacked machines, which
	means there will be no PTR record. Or, they may use dynamically assigned IP
	addresses that lead to server domains with highly generic names.

	Logging software also employs reverse lookups in order to provide users with
	human-readable domains in their log data, as opposed to a bunch of numeric
	IP addresses.

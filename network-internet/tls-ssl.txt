Transport Layer Security (TLS), the successor of the now-deprecated Secure
Sockets Layer (SSL), is a cryptographic protocol designed to provide
communications security over a computer network. The protocol is widely used in
applications such as email, instant messaging, and voice over IP, but its use as
the Security layer in HTTPS remains the most publicly visible.

The TLS protocol aims primarily to provide privacy and data integrity between
two or more communicating computer applications. It runs in the application
layer of the Internet and is itself composed of two layers: the TLS record and
the TLS handshake protocols.

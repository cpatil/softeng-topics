The Internet protocol suite, commonly known as TCP/IP, is the set of
communications protocols used in the Internet and similar computer networks. The
current foundational protocols in the suite are the Transmission Control
Protocol (TCP) and the Internet Protocol (IP).

During its development, versions of it were known as the Department of Defense
(DoD) model because the development of the networking method was funded by the
United States Department of Defense through DARPA. Its implementation is a
protocol stack.

The Internet protocol suite provides end-to-end data communication specifying
how data should be packetized, addressed, transmitted, routed, and received.
This functionality is organized into four abstraction layers, which classify all
related protocols according to each protocol's scope of networking. From lowest
to highest, the layers are the link layer, containing communication methods for
data that remains within a single network segment (link); the internet layer,
providing internetworking between independent networks; the transport layer,
handling host-to-host communication; and the application layer, providing
process-to-process data exchange for applications.

The technical standards underlying the Internet protocol suite and its
constituent protocols are maintained by the Internet Engineering Task Force
(IETF). The Internet protocol suite predates the OSI model, a more comprehensive
reference framework for general networking systems.

The application layer is the OSI layer closest to the end user, which means both
the OSI application layer and the user interact directly with the software
application. This layer interacts with software applications that implement a
communicating component. Such application programs fall outside the scope of the
OSI model. Application-layer functions typically include identifying
communication partners, determining resource availability, and synchronizing
communication. When identifying communication partners, the application layer
determines the identity and availability of communication partners for an
application with data to transmit. The most important distinction in the
application layer is the distinction between the application-entity and the
application. For example, a reservation website might have two
application-entities: one using HTTP to communicate with its users, and one for
a remote database protocol to record reservations. Neither of these protocols
have anything to do with reservations. That logic is in the application itself.
The application layer has no means to determine the availability of resources in
the network.

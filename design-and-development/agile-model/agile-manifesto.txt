Definition of business agility created by researchers of McKinsey & Company to
expand on this idea, who define Agile as “the ability to quickly reconfigure
strategy, structure, processes, people, and technology toward value-creating and
value-protecting opportunities.” These definitions reflect that Agile itself is
a mindset, not a technique. That’s where Agile methodologies come in.

Agile Alliance defines Agile as “the ability to create and respond to change. It
is a way of dealing with, and ultimately succeeding in, an uncertain and
turbulent environment.”

Manifesto for Agile Software Development

We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping
others do it. Through this work we have come to value:

	Individuals and interactions over processes and tools

	Working software over comprehensive documentation

	Customer collaboration over contract negotiation

	Responding to change over following a plan

That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on
the left more.

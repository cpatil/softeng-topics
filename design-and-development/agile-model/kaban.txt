Like other Agile methodologies, Kanban focuses on helping teams work together
more effectively to enable continuous delivery of quality products. Kanban is
unique, however, for offering a highly visual method for actively managing the
creation of products.

The Kanban Agile methodology relies on six fundamental practices:

    Visualize the workflow Limit work in progress Manage flow Make process
    policies explicit Implement feedback loops Improve collaboratively

Kanban achieves these practices through the use of a Kanban board. The Kanban
board facilitates the visual approach to Agile using columns to represent work
that is To Do, Doing, and Done. This Agile methodology improves collaboration
and efficiency and helps define the best possible team workflow.

The Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM) rounds out our list of well-known
Agile methodologies. DSDM originated in the 1990s as a way to provide a common
industry framework for rapid software delivery. Today, it has matured into a
comprehensive Agile methodology that revolves around:

    Business needs and value Active user involvement Empowered teams Frequent
    delivery Integrated testing Stakeholder collaboration

The DSDM framework is particularly useful for prioritizing requirements. It also
mandates that rework is to be expected, so any development changes must be
reversible. DSDM relies on sprints, similar to other Agile methodologies, and is
often used in conjunction with approaches like Scrum and XP.

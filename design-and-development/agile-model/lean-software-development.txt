Lean software development is more flexible than Scrum or XP, with fewer strict guidelines, rules, or methods. Lean is based on a set of principles developed to ensure value and efficiency in production in the mid 20th century and has evolved into the software setting. Lean relies on five principles of Lean management:

    Identify value
    Value stream mapping
    Create continuous workflow
    Create a pull system
    Continuous improvement

Lean particularly emphasizes eliminating waste. In the context of software development, that includes cutting out wasted time and unproductive tasks, efficiently using team resources, giving teams and individuals decision-making authority, and prioritizing only the features of a system that deliver true value.

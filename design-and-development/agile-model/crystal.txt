The Crystal Agile methodology focuses more on the interactions of the people
involved in a project versus the tools and techniques of development. A
lightweight model, Crystal emphasizes interaction, people, community, skills,
communications, and talents.

Crystal categorizes projects based on three criteria:

    Team size System criticality Project priorities

The approach is similar to other Agile methodologies in its attention to early
and often delivery of software, high involvement of users, and removal of red
tape. Crystalâ€™s assertion that every project is unique, however, has led to its
reputation as one of the most flexible Agile methodologies.

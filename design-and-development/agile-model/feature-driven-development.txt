Feature-Driven Development, or FDD, provides a framework for product development
that starts with an overall model and gets progressively more granular. Like
other Agile methodologies, FDD aims to deliver working software quickly in a
repeatable way. It uses the concept of “just enough design initially” (JEDI) to
do so, leveraging two-week increments to run “plan by feature, design by
feature, build by feature” iterations.

Organizations that practice Agile like Feature-Driven Development for its
feature-centric approach and its scalability.

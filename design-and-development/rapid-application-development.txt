Rapid-application development (RAD), also called rapid-application building
(RAB), is both a general term for adaptive software development approaches, and
the name for James Martin's method of rapid development. In general, RAD
approaches to software development puts less emphasis on planning and more
emphasis on an adaptive process. Prototypes are often used in addition to or
sometimes even instead of design specifications.

RAD is especially well suited for (although not limited to) developing software
that is driven by user interface requirements. Graphical user interface builders
are often called rapid application development tools. Other approaches to rapid
development include the adaptive, agile, spiral, and unified models.

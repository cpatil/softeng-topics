The most significant disadvantage of previous models (waterfall and spiral) is
that there were lots of customer rejection that happens after the application
was developed, and there was no involvement of the customers in between the
project.

Hence, they started the new approach, which is known as the prototype model. In
this, we will collect the requirements from the customer and prepare a prototype
(sample), and get it reviewed and approved by the customer. And only when they
satisfied, we will start working on the original projects so that there won't be
any customer rejection.

The prototype is just the sample or a dummy of the required software product. If
all the mentioned modules are present, then only the developer and tester will
perform prototype testing.

Prototyping Model has different phases, which are as follows:

    Requirement analysis
    Feasibility study
    Create a prototype
    Prototype testing
    Customer review and approval
    Design
    Coding
    Testing
    Installation and maintenance

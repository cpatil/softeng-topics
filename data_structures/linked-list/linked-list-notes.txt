Linked List
Is a linear collection of data elements whose order is not given by their physical placement in memory. Instead, each element points to the next.

Consists of a collection of nodes which together represent a sequence. This structure allows for efficient insertion or removal of elements form any position in the sequence during iteration. 

More complex variants add additional links, allowing more efficient insertion or removal of nodes at arbitrary positions

A drawback of linked lists is that access time is linear (and difficult to pipeline)

Faster access, such as random access, is not feasible. Arrays have better cache locality compared to linked lists

Used to implement lists, stacks, queues, associative arrays, and S-expressions, though it is not uncommon to implement those data structures directly without using a linked list as the basis

String
Immutable

Two utility classes for String manipulation are StringBuilder and StringBuffer

JVM String Pool
	Each time a string literal is created, the JVM checks the string literal pool first. If the string already exists in the string pool, a reference to the pooled instance returns.
	If the string does not exists in the pool, a new String object initializes and is placed in the pool

String '+' concatenation is an abstraction of StringBuffer

StringBuffer and StringBuilder are mutable objects with the methods: substring(), insert(), append(), delete()

StringBuffer:
	Thread safe and synchronized
	Used when multiple threads are working on the same String
	Slower than StringBuilder

StringBuilder:
	Not thread safe or synchronized
	Used in a single-threaded environment
	Faster than StringBuffer

Java - Access Modifiers

Java provides a number of access modifiers to set access levels for classes, variables, methods, and constructors. The four access levels are -
    - Visible to the package, the default (No modifiers are needed)
        -  The fields in an interface are implicitly public static final and the methods in an interface are by default public
    - Visible to the class only (private)
        - Class and interfaces cannot be private
        - Accessed by getter methods
        - Main way that an object encapsulates itself and hides data from the outside world
    - Visible to the world (public)
    - Visible to the package and all subclasses (protected)
        - Class and interfaces cannot be protected
        - Methods, fields can be declared protected, however methods and fields in a interface cannot be declared protected
        - Protected access gives the subclass a chance to use the helper method or variable, while preventing a nonrelated class from trying to use it

Access Control and Inheritance
The following rules for inherited methods are enforced -
    - Methods declared public in a superclass also must be public in all subclasses
    - Methods declared protected in a superclass must either be protected or public in subclasses; they cannot be private
    - Methods declared private are not inherited at all, so there is no rule for them

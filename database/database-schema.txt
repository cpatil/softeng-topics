Database Schema

In a relational database, the schema defines the tables, fields, relationships, views, indexes, packages, procedures, functions, queues, triggers, types, sequences, materialiezed views, synonyms, database links, directories, XML schemas, and other elements

Is its structure described in a formal language supported by the database management system. 

The term "schema" refers to the organization of data as a blueprint of how the database is constructed (divided into database tables in the case of relational databases)

The formal definition of a database schema is a set of formulas (sentences) called integrity constraints imposed on a database. These integrity constraints ensure compatibility between parts of the schema

The states of a created conceptual schema are transformed into an explicit mapping, this describes how real-world entities are modeled in the database

Based on the database administrator's knowledge of possible applications, the facts that can enter the database, or those of interest to the possible end-users

Ideal requirements for schema integration

Overlap preservation
    Each of the overlapping elements specified in the input mapping is also in a database schema relation

Extended overlap preservation
    Source-specific elements that are associated with a source's overlapping elements are passed through to the database schema

Normalization
    Indepenedent entities and relationships in the source data should not be grouped together in the same relation in the database schema. In particular, source specific schema elements should not be grouped with overlapping schema elements, if the grouping co-locates independent entities or relationships

Minimality
    If any elements of the database schema are dropped then the database schema is not ideal

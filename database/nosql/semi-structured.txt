The semi-structured model is a database model where there is no separation
between the data and the schema, and the amount of structure used depends on the
purpose.

The advantages of this model are the following:

    It can represent the information of some data sources that cannot be
    constrained by schema.
    
	It provides a flexible format for data exchange between different types of
	databases.
    
	It can be helpful to view structured data as semi-structured (for browsing
	purposes). The schema can easily be changed. The data transfer format may be
	portable.

The primary trade-off being made in using a semi-structured database model is
that queries cannot be made as efficiently as in a more constrained structure,
such as in the relational model. Typically the records in a semi-structured
database are stored with unique IDs that are referenced with pointers to their
location on disk. This makes navigational or path-based queries quite efficient,
but for doing searches over many records (as is typical in SQL), it is not as
efficient because it has to seek around the disk following pointers.

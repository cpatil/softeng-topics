Breadth-first search (BFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or
graph data structures. It starts at the tree root (or some arbitrary node of a
graph, sometimes referred to as a 'search key') and explores the neighbour nodes
first before moving to the next-level neightbours

Time complexity: O(Vertex + Edges)

Depth-first search (DFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or
graph data structures. One starts at the root (selecting some arbitrary node as
the root for a graph) and explore as far as possible along each branch before
backtracking

Time complexity: O(Vertex + Edges)

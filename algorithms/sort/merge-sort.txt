Merge sort is an efficient sorting algorithm that produces a stable sort, which
means that if two elements have the same value, they hold the same relative
position in the sorted sequence as they did in the input. In other words, the
relative order of elements with equal values is preserved in the sorted
sequence. Merge sort is a comparison sort, which means that it can sort any
input for which a less-than relation is defined

Merge sort is a Divid and Conquer

	1. Divide the unsorted array into n subarrays, each of size 1 (an array of
	size 1 is considered sorted)

	2. Repeatedly merge subarrays to produce new sorted subarrays until only 1
	subarray is left, which would be our sorted array

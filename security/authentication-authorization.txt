Authentication: Is the act of proving an assertion, such as the identity of a
computer system user. In contrast with identification, the act of indicating a
person or thing's identity, authentication is the process of verifying that
identity. It might invovle validating person identity documents, verifying the
authenticity of a website with a digital certificate, determining the age of an

Authorization: Is the function of specifying access rights/privileges to
resources, which is related to general information security and computer
security, and to access controler in particular. More formally, "to authorize"

access control rules to decide whether access requests from (authenticated)
consumers shall be approved (granted) or disapproved (rejected). Resources
include individual files or an item's data, computer programs, computer devices
and functionality provided by computer applications. Examples of consumers are
computer users, computer software and other hardware on the computer

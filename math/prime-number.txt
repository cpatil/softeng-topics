Prime number

Is a natural number greater than 1 that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers. A natural number greater than 1 that is not prime is called a composite number. 

For example, 5 is prime because the only ways of writing it as a product, 1 * 5 or 5 * 1, involve 5 itself. However, 4 is composite because it is a product (2 * 2) in which both numbers are smaller than 4. Primes are central in number theory because of the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic: every natural number greater than 1 is either a prime itself or can be factorized as a product of primes that is unique up to their order

Factorization: Consists of writing a number or another mathematical object as a product of several factors, usually smaller or simpler objects of the same kind. 

For example, 3 * 5 is a factorization of the integer 15, and (x - 2)(x - 2) is a factorization of the polynomial x^2 - 4

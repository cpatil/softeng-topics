Associative Array

An associative array, map, symbol table, or dictionary is an abstract data type
composed of a collection of (key, value) pairs, such that each possible key
appears at most once in the colelction.

Operations associated with this data type allow to:
	- Add a pair to the collection
	- Remove a pair from the collection
	- Modify an existing pair
	- Lookup a value associated with a particular key

Implementing associative arrays poses the dictionary problem, a classic computer
science problem: the task of designing a data structure that maintains a set of
data during 'search', 'delete', and 'insert' operations. The two major solutions
to the dictionary problem are a hash table and a search tree. In some cases it
is also possible to solve the problem using directly addressed arrays, binary
search trees, or other more specialized structures

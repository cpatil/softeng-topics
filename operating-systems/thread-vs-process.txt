In multiple processing environments, each process executes the same code but has
its own memory and file resources. 
+++

If one process is blocked, then no other process can execute until the first
process is unblocked. 
+++	
While one thread is blocked and waiting, a second thread in the same task can run.

Multiple processes without using threads use more resources. 
+++ 
Multiple threaded processes use fewer resources.

In multiple processes each process operates independently of the others.

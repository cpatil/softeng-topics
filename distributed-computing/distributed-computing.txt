Distributed computing is a field of computer science that studies distributed
systems. A distributed system is a system whose components are located on
different networked computers, which communicate and coordinate their actions by
passing messages to one another from any system. The components interact with
one another in order to achieve a common goal. Three significant characteristics
of distributed systems are: concurrency of components, lack of a global clock,
and independent failure of components. Examples of distributed systems vary
from SOA-based systems to massively multiplayer online games to peer-to-peer
applications.

A computer program that runs within a distributed system is called a distributed
program (and distributed programming is the process of writing such
programs). There are many different types of implementations for the message
passing mechanism, including pure HTTP, RPC-like connectors and message
queues.

Distributed computing also refers to the use of distributed systems to solve
computational problems. In distributed computing, a problem is divided into many
tasks, each of which is solved by one or more computers, which communicate
with each other via message passing.
